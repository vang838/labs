Once upon a time, in a land far Far away,
THere lived a brave knight.
he journeyed through forests, across the Sea,
In search of adventure, wild and free!
Along the Way, he met a wise old sage,
Who spoke of legends from a distant age.
Of Dragons fierce and treasures untold,
of mysteries hidden in mountains cold.
With sword in hand and heart full of cheer,
he embarked on a quest, without fear.
Through 1 darkened cave and 9 haunted halls,
He battled foes and scaled castle walls.
